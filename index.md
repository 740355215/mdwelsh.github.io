I am a technical lead manager at Google, where I work in the areas of mobile computing,
distributed systems, and networking. I lead the Chrome Cloud team, which spans multiple subteams:
Chrome Sync (synchronizing bookmarks, settings, tab history across a user's devices);
Chrome Data Saver (a proxy service to compress web pages); Google Cloud Messaging support
in Chrome; and multiple projects to improve Chrome's performance and functionality in emerging markets.

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at Harvard University from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at Intel Research, Berkeley from 2002-2003.
I did my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley (2002) and my bachelor's in Computer Science
at Cornell University (1996). My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space
of operating systems, networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, and programming languages.
