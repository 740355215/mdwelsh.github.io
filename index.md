I am a Principal Engineer at Google, where I work in the areas of mobile
computing, distributed systems, and networking. I lead the Chrome Mobile team at Google's Seattle
and Kirkland offices, focusing on making the web great for the next billion Internet
users in emerging markets. We work to reduce the cost and improve the performance of the web
on slower networks and devices, as well as new features to help everyone get the most out of
the web. Some of our team's projects include:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations - [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types), [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data)
* Developing new browser capabilities to help users discover new web content and more effectively multitask on small screens

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of mobile computing,
operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.

I also do a bunch of software and electronics projects under the banner of [Team Sidney Enterprises](https://teamsidney.com).

* [Volatile and Decentralized](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/) (my blog)
* [Resume](/mattwelsh-resume.pdf) and [Curriculum Vitae](/mattwelsh-cv.pdf)
