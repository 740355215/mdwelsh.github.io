I am a computer scientist and engineering lead at Google, where I work in the areas of mobile
computing, distributed systems, and networking. I lead the Chrome Mobile team at Google Seattle,
specifcally focusing on making the web great for the next billion Internet users in emerging
markets. We work to reduce the cost and improve the performance of the web on slower networks
and devices, as well as new features to help everyone get the most out of the web. Some of
our team's projects include:

* [Chrome Data Saver](/papers/flywheel-nsdi15.pdf), allowing Chrome to save more than 60% of mobile data
* Network optimizations for [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) and [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic)
* New techniques for optimizing web content using cloud rendering
* Support for saving, reading, and preloading [offline pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)
* Web platform API support for mobile adaptations (e.g., [Netinfo ECT](https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types], [Save-Data hints](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/save-data))
* and much more.

Prior to joining Google, I was a professor of Computer Science at
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) from
2003 until 2010, and a senior researcher at
[Intel Research](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/intel-research.html), Berkeley
from 2002-2003. I did my PhD in Computer Science at [UC Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) (2002)
and my bachelor's in Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) (1996).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in the space of mobile computing,
operating systems, networks, distributed systems, and programming languages.
